# Testable-Responsive-Profile-Card

## Overview:
This project implements a **Testable, Responsive Profile Card** using plain semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript.
The card displays:
- User name
- Avatar (Profile image)
- Short biography
- Current time (in milliseconds)
- Social links
- Hobbies list
- Dislikes list

Every visible element includes a **'data-testid' attribute** for stable automated testing.

The goal is to demonstrate **modern frontend patterns** like semantic structure, responsive layouts, accessibility best practices without external libraries or frameworks.
